## Bloccit

A Reddit clone assignment introduction into Ruby on Rails.

| Project Goals: |
| --- |
| Allow users to _sign-up_, _log-in_ (session persistence) and create __topics__ & __sub-posts__ |
| Once logged in users are able to _favorite_ each others posts as well as _vote_ (rank) public posts |
| Favoriting a post triggers an _e-mail notification_ update to post author |
| Users can become community moderators in order to manage other user posts |
